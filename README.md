## 🏛️ Thesis
Modern digital environments are engineered for extraction, fragmenting user attention through high-entropy visual noise and dopamine loops. **The Sovereign OS** is a browser-integrated "Void" designed to counter this.

It replaces the default "New Tab" experience with a high-aesthetic, low-entropy terminal that forces **Single-Task Intent**. It utilizes **Adlerian Psychology** (teleology/purpose-driven action) and **Stoic constraints** to eliminate "shiny object syndrome" and enforce deep work.

## ⚡ Functional Pillars

### 1. The Void (Visual Silence)
A pure black (`#000000`), distraction-free interface that resets cognitive load. No icons, no feeds, no links.

### 2. Intent Locking (The Guardrail)
Users must explicitly declare their immediate intent. Once declared, the interface **locks**. There is no "edit" or "back" button. The only way out is through completion.

### 3. Temporal Feedback (The Ticking Clock)
A dedicated session timer tracks the exact duration of the current "Deep Work" state, providing immediate quantitative feedback on agency regained.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** React (v18) + TypeScript
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first architecture)
* **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
* **Persistence:** LocalStorage (Planned for v1.1)

## 🗺️ Roadmap (Project: Iron Architect)

* **[v1.0]** Core Void Interface & Timer Logic (Completed)
* **[v1.1]** LocalStorage Persistence (Prevent refresh-scumming)
* **[v2.0]** **Kinetic Auth:** Integration with Computer Vision (TensorFlow.js) to unlock "Leisure Mode" only after physical exercise reps are detected.
* **[v3.0]** **Social Stealth:** "Share to Void" feature to document work without viewing social feeds.
