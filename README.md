## Thesis
Modern digital environments are engineered for extraction, fragmenting user attention through high-entropy visual noise and dopamine loops. **Focus Void** is a browser-integrated "Void" designed to counter this.

It replaces the default "New Tab" experience with a minimal terminal that forces **Single-Task Intent**. It utilizes psychology/purpose-driven action to eliminate "shiny object syndrome" and enforce deep work.
***

## Planned Features:

### 1. The Void (Action Page)
A pure black, distraction-free interface that resets cognitive load. No icons, no feeds, no links. Just things to get done.

### 2. Intent Locking (The Guardrail)
Users must explicitly declare their immediate intent. Once declared, the interface **locks**. There is no unlocking or reset. The only way out is through completion.

### 3. Temporal Feedback (The Ticking Clock)
A dedicated session timer tracks the exact duration of the current "Deep Work" state, providing immediate quantitative feedback on agency regained.
